Diabetes Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow

Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (from Kaggle/sklearn).

Preprocessing:

Cleaned and normalized the data.

Handled imbalanced dataset using resampling techniques to balance diabetic (1) and non-diabetic (0) cases.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Model Building: Applied KNN algorithm for classification.

Model Evaluation: Tested on unseen data; results showed proper and reliable predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Algorithm Used

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Classifies data based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python 

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ”¹ Results

The dataset imbalance was resolved before training.

The model was trained and tested successfully.

Achieved good accuracy and consistent performance on test data.
